            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              Aleef was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to make pet
              adoption accessible, transparent, and joyful for everyone. We
              connect caring families with pets in need of loving homes across
              Oman.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through our platform, we’ve facilitated thousands of successful
              adoptions and reunited countless lost pets with their families.
              We’re committed to animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.
